What is a variable?
$
Variables are used to store information in a way which can be manipluated by a computer.
$
This provides a way of labeling data.
$
In order to assign a value to a variable we use an = sign.

variable = value

$
Try to assign a variable called num_apples to the value 10. @print(num_apples==10)

$
You can also add variables together if they are both numbers e.g
a = 1
b = 2
a + b == 3
$
Not only can you add you can also perform other operations
such as;
    * multiplication
    + addition
    - subtraction
    / division
    // floor division
    % modulus
$
Try defining two variables x and y as 5 and 2 and multiply them together @print(x*y == 10)
